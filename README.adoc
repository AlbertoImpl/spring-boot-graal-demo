= Spring Boot GraalVM demo

This project is a minimal Spring Boot Reactive webapp designed to compile and run with GraalVM.

To build it, run `./build.sh`, and then to run it execute `com.example.graaldemo.graaldemoapplication`.

This application works fine with Graal 1.0.0-RC5 but not 1.0.0-RC6 due to https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/655[graal#655].

Other big issue is that it only works with functional bean registration because of https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/630[graal#630].
